# Gemini Project Context

This file is intended to be a journal of the development of this project, to be used to provide context to the Gemini assistant. It should be updated with every significant change.

## Project Overview

The project is a web-based system for creating and managing budgets for "El√©trica & Art", a company that seems to provide electrical and painting services.

## Development Log

### 2025-09-11 (Update 3)

*   **CRUD features for `novo-or√ßamento.html`:**
    *   Added Edit (‚úèÔ∏è) and Delete (üóëÔ∏è) icons with corresponding functionality to the budget list.
    *   Clicking the edit icon populates the form with the selected budget's data for modification.
    *   The form logic now handles both creating new budgets and updating existing ones.
    *   Clicking the delete icon prompts for confirmation and removes the budget from local storage.

### 2025-09-11 (Update 2)

*   **`novo-or√ßamento.html` Refactoring:**
    *   Overhauled the page to align with the new local storage-based architecture.
    *   The form now saves budget data directly to local storage.
    *   The page now lists all budgets saved in local storage and includes a preview feature.

### 2025-09-11 (Update 1)

*   **New Budget Management System:**
    *   Pivoted from creating individual HTML files for budgets to a single-page application model.
    *   Created `gerenciador-orcamentos.html`, a central interface for full CRUD operations.
    *   Budget data is now stored client-side in the browser's local storage.
*   **`index.html`:**
    *   Added a "Gerenciador" link in the navigation bar pointing to the new `gerenciador-orcamentos.html` page.

### 2025-09-11 (Initial)

*   **`novo-or√ßamento.html` (Legacy):**
    *   Initially created as a form to generate the content for new budget files.
*   **`index.html`:**
    *   Added a link to `novo-or√ßamento.html` in the navigation bar.

## Future Intentions

*   Refine the `gerenciador-orcamentos.html` page with more advanced features, such as data export/import, improved printing templates, and more detailed status tracking for each budget.

## Instructions for Gemini

*   When asked to make changes, update the "Development Log" in this file with a summary of the changes.
*   Before making changes, consult this file to understand the project's context and history.
*   `gerenciador-orcamentos.html` is the primary, full-featured budget management tool.
*   `novo-or√ßamento.html` serves as a simplified tool for creating, previewing, and managing budgets. Both pages use the same local storage (`EaOrcamentosDB`).
*   The old workflow of creating individual HTML files is deprecated.
